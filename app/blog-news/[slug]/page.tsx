    <ul>
      <li><strong>Welding Process</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose equipment based on your primary welding method (e.g., TIG, MIG, or induction welding). KVE is ideal for thermoplastic composite welding, while Kemppi and Miller excel in TIG.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Material Type</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure the equipment supports the materials you work with, such as aluminum, stainless steel, or thermoplastic composites for KVE.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Portability</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>For fieldwork, opt for lightweight models like ESAB’s Rebel series. KVE’s equipment is better suited for stationary, high-volume production.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Power Requirements</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Check if the equipment matches your power supply (e.g., 110V or 220V for traditional welders; specialized power for KVE’s induction systems).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Budget</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Lincoln Electric and ESAB offer cost-effective options, while KVE and Fronius cater to premium, specialized needs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Warranty and Support</strong>
